# Flutter_FeatureFilledTextForms
Form Features that improve your apps UX! 
- Auto Scrolling to Fields (onFocus, onError, onType), 
- Field Validation, 
- Automatic Field Refocusing (with tons of options), 
- and more! 

Documentation: IN PROGRESS

Features Being Added: 
- pressing backspace or clear on an empty field refocuses to the previous field
- switching between log in and sign up should be a simple showing and hiding of fields

Note: 
- Refocus Function does not cover all cases but it does cover most cases. 
- Additional refocusing features could be added by marking fields as required or not and separating this from the validation process. 
----- So a field could still have requirements regardless of whether or not its required for form submission.
---------- ideally if its not required then you should never display an error but rather always display the validation result in helper text
----- EX: phone number (not required) but it can only include numbers, and perhaps a restriction to only US number format
